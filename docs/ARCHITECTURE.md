# Architecture

OpenClaw Workspace is a thin web shell over an OpenClaw gateway. It deliberately
owns very little logic: the agent's brain, memory, tools, and skills all live in
OpenClaw. This document explains the moving parts.

```
 browser (SPA)  ──HTTP/SSE──▶  FastAPI app  ──WebSocket──▶  OpenClaw gateway
   frontend/                   backend/app.py               (the brain, :18789)
                               backend/bridge.py  ◀── the load-bearing piece
```

## The bridge (`backend/bridge.py`)

The one piece of genuinely new logic. The SPA speaks the HTTP+SSE dialect of a
typical chat backend (a `POST /api/chat_stream` that streams `data:` frames). The
gateway speaks its own JSON-over-WebSocket protocol and emits structured `chat`
and tool events. The bridge:

1. Opens a WebSocket to the gateway, authenticating with the password read from
   `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (never stored here).
2. Sends the user's turn on a **web-only session key** (`agent:main:web`) so the
   web UI never contends with other channels (e.g. Signal) that share the agent.
3. Translates gateway events back into the SSE frames the SPA expects — including
   tool-call start/output, which is what renders the live tool panels.

Because inference runs through the gateway's existing OAuth/subscription token,
there is **no per-token API billing** and no API key in this repo.

### Gateway method contract

The workspace requires the gateway to speak these methods (the read-only ones are
verified live by `scripts/doctor.sh`):

`chat.send`, `chat.abort`, `chat.history`; `sessions.create/delete/patch/json`;
`models.list`, `models.authStatus`; `cron.list/run/runs/update`;
`skills.status/update`.

If your OpenClaw is older and missing one, the doctor reports it (probing the
param-less read-only methods `models.list`, `skills.status`, `cron.list`).

### `MIN_OPENCLAW` advisory

There is no hard version pin. `MIN_OPENCLAW` (when referenced in scripts) is
advisory only — the real floor is the method contract above. The doctor probes
those methods directly and reports any that are absent, so a too-old OpenClaw
surfaces a clear "method not found" message rather than a version-number comparison.
This means the workspace works with any OpenClaw that speaks the listed methods,
regardless of its release tag.

### Steering (2026-09)

A message sent while a claude-cli turn is running is injected into that turn:
`POST /api/chat/steer/{id}` → `chat.send` on the active session → the gateway's
steer queue → (patched) claude-cli reply handle `queueMessage` → Claude Code
stdin, delivered after the current tool result. The patch lives in
`deploy/gateway-patches/`; `GET /api/capabilities` reports `steer` only when the
running bundle carries it. Sessions on other runtimes keep the client-side queue.

## The app (`backend/app.py`)

A FastAPI application that:

- Serves the built SPA from `frontend/` (static files).
- Exposes `/api/chat_stream` (the bridge), `/api/config` (branding), `/api/health`,
  and a set of per-tab routers (`inbox`, `email`, `calendar`, `notes`, `documents`,
  `cron`, `memory`, `skills`, `research`, …). Each router is a thin adapter over an
  existing data source or an OpenClaw gateway method.

Config resolution lives in `backend/config.py`: env var → `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
→ default. Secrets only ever come from the gateway config or the environment.

### Change review (2026-09)

`backend/changes.py` observes the filesystem around every turn: per watched
root an index (path → mtime, size, sha256) plus a content-addressed cache of
the last seen text content. The turn recorder refreshes at turn start
(absorbing between-turn writes) and 1.5 s after turn end (this turn's change
set, flagged `shared` when another turn was active). Diffs are computed on
request from the cached blobs; revert restores the turn's before-state only if
the file has not moved on. Roots and prune list live in `.data/changes.json`
(Settings → Changes). It never uses git.

## The frontend: vendor + overrides + bake

The UI is a vanilla-JS SPA. It is assembled, not hand-edited in place:

- **`frontend-vendor/`** — the committed neutral SPA base (the source of truth for
  the upstream files). Brand-neutral: it says "Odysseus" where a name is needed.
- **`frontend-overrides/`** — durable, workspace-specific customizations layered on
  top (full-file overrides + additive CSS/JS). User-visible brand text here uses
  the `__AGENT_NAME__` token. See that folder's README for the full inventory.
- **`scripts/sync-frontend.sh`** — the build: rsync the base → `frontend/`, copy the
  overrides over it, inject add-on `<script>`/`<link>` tags, **bake** `__AGENT_NAME__`
  and rebrand the base's "Odysseus" strings to the configured agent name.
- **`frontend/`** — the gitignored build output that actually gets served.

So one config value (the agent name) propagates to the whole UI at build time;
`GET /api/config` also exposes it for any runtime use.

## Branding flow (the headline feature)

```
scripts/setup.sh  ──writes──▶  .data/branding.json {"agent_name": "..."}
       │                              │
       │                              ├──▶ backend/config.agent_name()  ──▶ /api/config
       └──runs──▶ sync-frontend.sh  ──┘    (env WORKSPACE_AGENT_NAME overrides both)
                       │
                       └──bakes __AGENT_NAME__ + Odysseus→name──▶ frontend/
```

`.data/` is gitignored, so a user's chosen name never lands in the repo.

## Deployment

A single uvicorn process. Bind `127.0.0.1` and front it with a private network
(Tailscale `tailscale serve`) — there is **no app auth** (single-user by design).
`scripts/install-launchagent.sh` renders `deploy/*.plist.template` for macOS;
on Linux run the same uvicorn command from a systemd unit.

## v2 modules (installable-anywhere)

The v2 branch added these backend modules to make the workspace installable on any
OpenClaw without editing source. One line each for contributor navigation:

- **`config.agent_id()` / `config.load_connection()`** — derive the agent id and
  gateway connection details from env vars → `.data/connection.json` →
  `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, in that precedence order.
- **`doctor.py` + `GET /api/doctor` + `scripts/doctor.sh`** — read-only preflight:
  gateway reachability, auth, agent id resolution, and the method-contract probe.
- **`capabilities.py` + `GET /api/capabilities`** — data-driven tab gating; each tab
  reports itself as available only when its tooling is present and configured.
- **`email_config.py`** — renders a himalaya account block and writes the
  mode-600 password file; invoked by `scripts/setup.sh --add-email`.
- **`calendar.py`** (provider-selecting router) + **`calendar_config.py`** (provider
  selector, defaulting to google) + **`calendar_caldav.py`** (CalDAV client) +
  **`ical.py`** (dependency-free VEVENT (de)serializer); `calendar_google.py` was
  refactored to plain provider functions. All wired via `setup.sh --add-calendar`.
- **`inbox/settings.py`** — config-driven collector selection via `.data/inbox.json`
  (default: all collectors on; precedence env > inbox.json > built-in default).
- **`auth_gate.py`** — optional pure-ASGI token gate (`WORKSPACE_AUTH_TOKEN` env
  var, off by default, SSE-safe so streaming turns are not buffered by middleware).

## What lives where

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Model access, inference billing | OpenClaw gateway |
| Memory, RAG, "dreaming" consolidation | OpenClaw |
| Tools, skills, MCP servers | OpenClaw |
| Chat transport + tool-panel rendering | the bridge |
| Tabs (inbox/email/calendar/docs/…) | thin adapters in `backend/` |
| Branding, UI assembly | `frontend-*` + `sync-frontend.sh` |
| Per-integration config (accounts, secrets) | gitignored `.data/*.json`; secrets in mode-600 files or env — never in JSON |
